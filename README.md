### update logs

V1.3.6 - June 7, 2024
- AI was too hard, so i added in some dynamic difficulty scaling, which adjusts the AI's difficulty based on the score difference.

V1.3.4 - June 7, 2024
- Completely Removed the Reaction Delay: Eliminated the reaction delay entirely to make the AI respond instantaneously to the ballâ€™s position.
- Increased AIs Paddle Speed: Boosted the AIs paddle speed further to match or exceed the ball speed, making it more agile.
- Improved Precision: Made sure that the AI follows the ball very closely, almost matching its movement. Hoping this doesnt make it too hard.
